    <p>
      Hi,<br>I’m Jason Watson—a web development specialist with over a decade of experience building effective and user-friendly digital solutions. I focus on creating accessible, efficient websites that align with both technical requirements and business goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I serve as a Senior Web Developer at the University of Texas at Austin, where I design and develop custom Drupal themes and modules with a focus on reusability and ease of use for content editors. I’ve honed my expertise in managing the entire web development lifecycle while collaborating with designers and stakeholders to transform complex ideas into seamless digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background spans a variety of roles, from maintaining a WordPress Multisite hosting over 900 sites to engineering robust solutions using Ruby on Rails and modern JavaScript frameworks. Whether migrating large-scale sites to the cloud, optimizing workflows with DevOps tools, or building APIs, I thrive on tackling challenges with precision and creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my technical skills, my journey has been shaped by diverse experiences—from serving in the U.S. Air Force as a helicopter crew chief to mentoring elementary students through AmeriCorps. These roles have instilled in me a strong work ethic, a commitment to collaboration, and a deep appreciation for problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest in web development, working on personal projects, or spending time with my family here in Austin, Texas. Let’s create something extraordinary together.
